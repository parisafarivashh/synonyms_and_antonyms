### WordNet

The WordNet is a part of Python’s Natural Language Toolkit. It is a large 
collection of words and vocabulary from the English language that are 
related to each other and are grouped in some way. A collection of similar 
words is called lemmas.


Also, It’s a combination of dictionary and thesaurus. It is used for automatic text analysis and artificial intelligence applications. It supports many other languages in its collection.
